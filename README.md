The R script, run_analysis.R, contains the following:

Download the dataset that contains the dataset, which contains the results of the study by Anguita et al (2012)
Load the activity info, feature info, training and test datasets.
Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
Merges the two datasets
Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
